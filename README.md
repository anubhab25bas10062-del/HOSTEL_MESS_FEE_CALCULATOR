# HOSTEL_MESS_FEE_CALCULATOR
The Hostel Mess Fee calculator is a comprehensive and user friendly Python Program designed to automate and simplify the calculation of monthly mess charges for hostel students, based on Veg, Non-Veg and Jain options, add-on services and performance based discounts. It provides clear breakdown of fees, making billing transparent &amp; accurate.In many educational institutions, mess fee structure vary based on food preferences, additional services, and student performance-based concessions.
The Project aims to address this real-world requirement by providing a smart, interactive, and well organized system that computes the final payable amount with accuracy and clarity.
The Program begins by offering the user a selection of three widey-used mess types - Veg, Non-Veg, and Jain - each with its own pre-defined fee structure.The system furthur allows them to choose optiona services such as milk suppy or special meals, both of which add to the total monthly cost. A key feature of this project is its integration of performance-based discounts, acknowledging many instituitions reward meritorious student with partial fee wavers. Student can categorize their performance as Excellent, Good, Average resulting in a discount of 20%, 10% or 0% respectively.
This project effectively showcases the use of fundamental Python Concepts such as variables,conditional statements, user input handling, and arithmatic operations,making it an ideal toolfor beginners while remaining practical enough for instituitional use.
