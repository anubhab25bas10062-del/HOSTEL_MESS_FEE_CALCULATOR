HOSTEL MESS FEE CALCULATOR



1\. Problem Statement

Many Hostels follow different mess fee structures based on food preferences, optional services, performance-based concessions. however, calculating the final monthly fee manually can be time-consuming, error prone and inconsistent. Student often lack clarity about how their total fee is computed while administrators struggle to maintain transparency and accuracy. There is a need for an automated system that can calculate the monthly mess fee based on mess-types, add-ons and performance based discounts.



2\. Scope Of The Project

The Scope of this project includes developing a Python-based interactive program that computes the hostel mess fee for a single student at a time:-

* Allow users to select mess types - Veg, Non-Veg, or Jain
* Include optional add-on services like milk and special meals
* Provide performance-based discount options
* Calculate gross fee, discount amount, and final payable fee
* Display a structured summary of all fee components

The program focuses on simplicity, clarity, and accuracy. While the current scope is limited to single-user calculations, it can be extended to multi-user handling, data storage and automation.



3\. Target Users

* Hostel/Students - To understand their monthly mess fee breakdown clearly
* Mess Administrators - To automate fee calculation and reduce manual errors
* Educational Institutions - For integration simple fee-calculation systems in campus management
* Beginner Python Learners - As a practical example of using variables, conditionals, and input handling



4\. High-Level Features 

* Mess Type Selection (widely known): Veg, Non-Veg, Jain
* Add-On Choices: Milk, Special Meals, Both or none
* Performance Discounts: 20%, 10% or 0% based on Student's category
* Automated Fee Calculation - Gross fee, discount \& final fee
* Detailed Output Summary: Clear breakdown of every charge
* User-Friendly Interaction: Simple menu-style input and readable output
* Expandable Design: Can later include menus, data storage or OOP structure
